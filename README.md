# PROG 01: Crunch Time

Briefly describe your app here.
My app lets a user choose whether they want to convert an amount of exercise into the calories ones burn by doing that, or if they want to convert an amount of calories into the exercise that will burn that. It works with exercises: Pushups, sit-ups, squats, leg-lifts, plank, jumping jacks, pull-ups, cycling, walking, jogging, swimming, stair climbing. 

My app gives motivational text when the conversion happens to encourage the user to keep on exercising. A user is able to navigate between the two functions of conversion.
